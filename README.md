# Story-App

The Story App is a mobile app that allows users to create and share stories. Users can create stories by providing a title, description, and image. They can also specify the location of the story, which will be displayed on a map.

The app is developed using Kotlin, a modern programming language that is known for its conciseness and readability. The layout of the app is created using XML, which is a markup language that is used to define the structure and content of an Android app.

The app uses the Dicoding Academy REST API to retrieve and store data. The Dicoding Academy REST API is a RESTful API that provides access to data about stories. The app also uses the Geo Maps API to display the location of the story on a map.
